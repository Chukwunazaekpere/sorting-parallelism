The purpose of this, is to implement a new algorithm for sorting, which I **(Chukwunazaekpere Obioma)** 
came up with, called the "last-index" or "Bende" sorting algorithm. 

""The name of this sorting algorithm, as designed by me, is referred to as 'last-index' or 'Bende' sorting. The algorithm begins by comparing
    the element at index zero, to the last element in the array(or element at index: -1). If it 
    finds that the element at zero index, is greater than that at index -1, it swaps the indices of the 
    elements. Otherwise, it skips. Then, it moves to the element at index 1 and repeats. After going through the 
    elements for the first iteration, it reduces the length of the array by 1, as it no longer makes comparison with the 
    element at index -1. The second iteration is now, between the elements with that at index -2, which at this point, is
    likened as the element at the last index""
